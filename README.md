# auto-msk-model
repository to develop automated methods for generating musculoskeletal models from segmented anatomical structures

# Requirements
Requires:
* Matlab
* OpenSim API

# Test geometries
Test geometries are available for developers (DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE!) at [this link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/wk4izo66qxbxp3h/AABAcyxpHkfWy1v5AjJ7QOIYa?dl=0).
You can simply copy them in the "test_geometries" directory and adapt the scripts.

# TO DO
- [ ] Streamline MSK workflow
- [ ] upgrade to OpenSim 4.0
- [ ] fit ankle joint
- [ ] fit patellar groove as in [this paper](https://www.dropbox.com/s/diajesc737ujdsd/SancisiJMR11.pdf?dl=0)
