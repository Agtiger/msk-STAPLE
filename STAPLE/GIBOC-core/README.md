# GIBOC-Knee-Coordinate-System  

The [GIBOK-knee toolbox](https://github.com/renaultJB/GIBOC-Knee-Coordinate-System) was created to construct anatomical coordinate system  for the knee bones (femur, patella and tibia).
That toolbox was included in the workflow we developed for creating musculoskeletal models in an automated way.

# Important notes
Please be aware that: 
1. The toolbox has been **extended and modified** to process also the pelvis and to better suit the needs of musculoskeletal modelling tasks;
2. The toolbox has been forked from the original repository at [commit d8f34b9c](https://github.com/renaultJB/GIBOC-Knee-Coordinate-System/commit/d8f34b9cf1b39a77af3cb7b6b2afbf7889321b46) and **developed independently** after that;
3. The [**original** toolbox](https://github.com/renaultJB/GIBOC-Knee-Coordinate-System) is associated with the following publication:
